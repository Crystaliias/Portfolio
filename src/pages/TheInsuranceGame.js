                <p>The Insurance was made during my 3rd year at Penn State Behrend for my DIGIT 400 class
                    This portion of the class was a work shop in collaboration with a local 
                    insurance company and our goal was to make a list of insurance terms to be 
                    more excessible. My group decided that we should gameify it we decided to make a 
                    visual novel type of game that will have you be an observer watching an interaction
                    between an insurance agent and their client. I did the character design for this
                    project and contibuted a lot of conecpt ideas to implement. <a href="
