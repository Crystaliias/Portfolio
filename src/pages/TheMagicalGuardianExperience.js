                <p>The Magical Guardian Experience is a table top role playing game
                    concept that I made during my 2nd year at Penn State Behrend in
                    my GAME 220 class. It is heavily inspired by the Magical Girl
                    Genre so think of things like Sailor Moon or Puella Magi Madoka Magica.
                    This is one of my most favorite things that I have made. I did all 
                    of the illustrations and the core gameplay is based around the D20 die 
                    system.
